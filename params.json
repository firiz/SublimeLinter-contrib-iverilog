If SublimeLinter 3 is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html).\r\n\r\n### Linter installation\r\nBefore installing this plugin, you must ensure that `iverilog` is installed on your system.\r\nTo install `iverilog`, please see [this](http://iverilog.wikia.com/wiki/Installation_Guide).\r\n\r\n### Plugin installation\r\nPlease use [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) to install the linter plugin. This will ensure that the plugin will be updated when new versions are available. If you want to install from source so you can modify the source code, you probably know what you are doing so we won’t cover that here.\r\n\r\nTo install via Package Control, do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Within Sublime Text, bring up the [Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-3/extensibility/command_palette.html) and type `install`. Among the commands you should see `Package Control: Install Package`. If that command is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it. There will be a pause of a few seconds while Package Control fetches the list of available plugins.\r\n\r\n1. When the plugin list appears, type `iverilog`. Among the entries you should see `SublimeLinter-contrib-iverilog`. If that entry is not highlighted, use the keyboard or mouse to select it.\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\nFor general information on how SublimeLinter works with settings, please see [Settings](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/settings.html). For information on generic linter settings, please see [Linter Settings](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/linter_settings.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Constraints\r\n\r\n- You have to include your module like `` `include \"xxx.v\"`` rather than write all .v files while doing a simulatoin. `iverilog xxx.v xxx_t.v -o a.out`\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Fork the plugin repository.\r\n1. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`.\r\n1. Commit and push the topic branch.\r\n1. Make a pull request.\r\n1. Be patient.  ;-)\r\n\r\nPlease note that modications should follow these coding guidelines:\r\n\r\n- Indent is 4 spaces.\r\n- Code should pass flake8 and pep257 linters.\r\n- Vertical whitespace helps readability, don’t be afraid to use it.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping out!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
